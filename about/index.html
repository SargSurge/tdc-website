            <h2 id="about-subheader">Our Brotherhood</h2>
            <p>Theta Delta Chi boasts a tight-knit group of 30+ active brothers from a variety of different backgrounds. Brothers have attended public, private, and boarding schools as well as being home-schooled. They hail from all areas of the United States as well as internationally from Latin America, the Caribbean, and Europe. Their broad backgrounds are exemplified by the fact that brothers major in almost every engineering major at MIT as well as non-engineering majors and/or minors in fields such as music, biology, management, economics, and brain and cognitive sciences.
                Brother involvement extends throughout the MIT campus. Current brothers are on the executive boards of DanceTroupe, Live Music Connection, Dramashop, Colleges Against Cancer, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and the Interfraternity Council. Brother involvement on campus extends into student government, intramural sports, academic groups, and community service.
                Recent graduates have gone into Master's and Doctoral programs at schools including MIT, Yale, and University of Michigan. Others have gone directly into technical fields either nearby in Boston or exploring the world. Many alumni create start-ups with other Theta Delta Chi brothers and provide internships and career support for active brothers.</p>

            <h2 id="about-subheader">Our Mansion</h2>
            <p>Originally the house of an MIT chancellor, the house at 372 Memorial Drive boasts common areas such as a TV room, a pool room, a music room, an Athena cluster, and a dining room. Facilities extend to a House Manager's closet stocked with power tools, a professional chef's kitchen, and decks and balconies on every floor. There is even a pub taking up most of the basement that functions as a dance floor and an all-purpose venue for social gatherings.
                Rooms are packed with contributions from actives and alumni alike including lofts, murals, and an indoor rock climbing wall overlooking the Charles River. The second floor is home to the house Resident Advisor — a Theta Delta Chi alumnus — and his partner in a newly remodeled two-room area used as a bedroom and an office. The Theta Delta Chi five-story waterfront mansion offers the feel of a fraternity house, the beauty of the Charles River, and the convenience of the MIT campus and facilities.</p>

            <h2 id="about-subheader">Our History</h2>
            <p>The Theta Deuteron Mansion was acquired 49 years ago. Our original house once rested on 314 Memorial Dr.
                Lady McCormick was a U.S. biologist, suffragist, and philanthropist. Graduating from MIT in 1904, she would donate the money to found Stanley McCormick Hall, an all female dormitory; her goal was to provide female students a permanent place at MIT; she had one request: to see the construction of the building in her life-time.
                On February 1956, Lady McCormick announced a muti-million dollar donation to build the McCormick East and West Wing. They needed old 314 to do it.
                On December 1957, a deal brokered between Lyndsay Russel and MIT granted Theta Delta Chi the land title to the Dean's Mansion on 372, in exchange for the title to our mansion on 314 (present day McCormick West Wing). In 1966 the first Theta Delta Chi pledge class was initiated in the Theta Deuteron Mansion. The McCormick towers opened in 1963 (west tower) and 1967 (east tower). Lady McCormick passed two years later, leaving a stronger, permanent home for one all-female as well one all-male community at MIT.</p>

            <h2 id="about-subheader">Our Social Life</h2>
            <p>Exemplifying the unofficial MIT motto of "Work Hard, Play Hard," Theta Delta Chi hosts weekly social events in all forms for brothers, friends, and the Boston-Cambridge community at large to de-stress and have fun. Events range from large parties in our pub with a DJ Booth and custom light shows to mixers with MIT sororities to small themed parties for close and future friends of the house. Dance classes are notorious for attracting large audiences to let out their inner swag with some hip hop or to explore new areas of dance and culture with salsa dancing.
                Theta Delta Chi is also host to the annual CPW GLOW Party. Here, light shows, glow sticks, necklaces, and glasses combine with hot DJ mixes to create an unforgettable experience where throwdowns on the dance floor are not out of the question.
                More private social events include an annual hiking trip, beach trips, and weekend retreats. During the early fall semester, you will find brothers sailing on the river enjoying the cool breeze before the winter months bring in snow, at which point they grab their snowboards and head for the mountains.
                Additionally, Theta Delta Chi hosts a formal each semester. The Fall Formal, called Alumni Banquet, is attended by hundreds of alumni, active brothers, and dates alike. Alumni are invited to a celebratory dinner in Boston, where the achievements of alumni and actives are recognized and MIT faculty and staff are thanked for the support they show during the school year. Spring Banquet is hosted the next semester to celebrate the achievements of the year, to thank friends of the fraternity for their support, and to say goodbye to the seniors who always leave Theta Delta Chi better than they found it.</p>
